            <p>
                Hello!
            </p>

            <p>
                My name is Cindy. I was born in country Latvia. You can find this country in Europe.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I live in NC Charlotte. Love this country and this state.
                According to my teacher we need to have two paragraphs for this project. That is why I will
                use jokes to fill out the space. Thank you for understanding and sorry for inconvenience, and I hope
                you
                will like jokes.
            </p>

            <p>
                First joke:Judge: “Why did you steal the car?”
                Man: “I had to get to work.”
                Judge: “Why didn’t you take the bus?”
                Man: I don’t have a driver’s license for the bus.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second joke:The police stop an old guy in questionable condition at 1 am.
                “What are you doing out so late, sir?” asks the police officer.
                “I’m going to a seminar on ‘The harmful effects of alcohol’,” replies the man.
                “Are you pulling my leg or something?!“ says the police officer, „who would hold a seminar like that
                at this
                hour?!”
                The man sighs,
                “my wife.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Third joke:I have a very good feeling about my job interview today. The manager said they were
                looking for
                somebody responsible.
                “You’ve found your man,” I responded, “whenever there was a problem in my last job, they always said
                that I
                was responsible!”
                One more joke for fun:When I drink coffee I can’t sleep.
                Really? I have the exact opposite.
                Wow, seriously?
                Yes, when I sleep I can’t drink coffee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Couple more jokes for fun.
                The guy who invented Systane had his funeral today.
                There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
            </p>

            <p>
                I got fired from my job as a taxi driver.
                It turns out my customers didn't like it when I tried to go the extra mile.
            </p>

            <p>
                My Dad said to me, "Son, I wanted you to know you were adopted."
                I shouted, "You're kidding! Really?"
                He said, "Yes. Get your things together, they're coming to pick you up in an hour."
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for having me!
            </p>

            <p>
                With respect Cindy
